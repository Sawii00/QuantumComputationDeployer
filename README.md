Thesis project for the Bachelor in Computer, Electronics, and Telecommunications Engineering at UniPR. 

## Abstract
_The growing demand for large-scale quantum computers is motivating research on distributed quantum computing (DQC) architectures [1]. To support the research community in the design and evaluation of distributed quantum protocols, many simulators
have been devised to aid with the construction of the topology and the deployment of
computations on it [2, 3, 4, 5]. However, the process of setting up a simulation requires
strong expertise in the simulator itself, thus being inconvenient for those who are only
interested in quantum protocol evaluation or in the design of supporting tools such as
quantum compilers. In this work, we present a software tool denoted as DQC Executor,
that accepts as input the description of the network and the code of the algorithm, and
then executes the simulation by automatically constructing the network topology and
mapping the computation onto it, in a framework-agnostic way and transparently to the
user._
