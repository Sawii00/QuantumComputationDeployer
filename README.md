## Abstract
_In this work, we present a software tool denoted as DQC Executor,
that accepts as input the description of the network and the code of the algorithm, and
then executes the simulation by automatically constructing the network topology and
mapping the computation onto it, in a framework-agnostic way and transparently to the
user._
